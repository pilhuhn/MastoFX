= MastoFX

A simple Mastodon client written in JavaFX.

Why? Because I can. And because the pretty powerful desktop client
I am using has some things that annoy me -- and as far as I can tell,
there is no source code available for it.

== Using

To use it, you need to go to your Mastodon account and in the developer
section get an access token. This and the server name needs to go into
a file in your home directory, called `.mastoFx.properties`

.Example ~/.mastoFx.properties file
----
server=mastodon.social
token=HulaLulaToken
----

Then on the command line run `mvn javafx:run`
